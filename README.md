üöÄ Spoofer.exe ‚Äî Public Free-Trial Release (v2.35)

Hey folks!
After way too many late-night coding sessions, coffee overdoses, and a few blue-screen scares, I‚Äôm finally ready to share the first public build of my HWID spoofing / system-cleaning toolkit. This drop is a limited free-trial edition ‚Äì perfect for anyone who wants to kick the tires before the full release lands around 05 / 06 / 2025.


What does it do?

1. HWID Spoofing
‚Ä¢ One-click spoof for CPU, GPU, Motherboard, MAC, or run the all-in-one HWIDCore.
‚Ä¢ Generates fresh IDs every session ‚Äì no recycled ‚Äúpublic‚Äù blobs.
‚Ä¢ Optional registry backup so you can roll back if you get cold feet.

2. Deep Cleaning
‚Ä¢ Flush DNS, reset Winsock / TCP-IP, purge temp folders, wipe browser caches.
‚Ä¢ Dedicated ‚ÄúMaster Cleaner‚Äù that chains every scrub routine in one pass.

3. Game & Anti-Cheat Purging (trial build already supports these)
‚Ä¢ Call of Duty (MW II, MW III, Warzone ‚Äî COD 19/20/21)
‚Ä¢ Fortnite
‚Ä¢ Battlefield 2042
‚Ä¢ Delta Force (2024)
‚Ä¢ GTA V & FiveM
‚Ä¢ Apex Legends

Anti-cheat leftovers it zaps: EA Anti-Cheat, BattlEye, Easy Anti-Cheat, Vanguard, DAC, RootkitAC.

4. License / Update System
‚Ä¢ CLI wizard for activation ‚Äì no sketchy launchers.
‚Ä¢ Server ping to disable outdated builds (keeps everyone on the same page).
‚Ä¢ Auto-update toggle in app_config.json.

What‚Äôs missing in the trial?
The paid build already has a couple of goodies baking in QA ‚Äì full MAC randomizer, advanced kernel hooks, scheduler-based stealth mode, plus an experimental bypass module for a few unannounced titles. They‚Äôre not in this ZIP, sorry! Still under heavy testingüõ†Ô∏è




Free-Trial Keys :

Pop open LICENSE.md ‚Äì you‚Äôll find two blocks of codes:

    FREE-DAY-01-XXXX ‚Üí activates 4 days
    FREE-DAY-02-XXXX ‚Üí extend for another 4 days

No email sign-up, no HWID lock until the moment you activate. Think of it as a weekend + a bit extra to see if it‚Äôs worth your wallet.
You may get a random 10 days codes in between good luck..
used codes are regualery replaced with new one's until i feel it xD.


Roadmap & Release Date
Anti-cheat bypass suite in heavy testing (we‚Äôve bricked three VMs so you don‚Äôt have to).
UI rewrite: curses-style theme + progress bars instead of walls of text.
C++ injector module (optional) for users who hate Python dependencies.

wish me luck it's personal challange to build and test with multi platforms alone to get something for the end user that he loves and easy to use.
